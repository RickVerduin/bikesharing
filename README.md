## Summary
- Citi Bike is most polular for short trips, with the largest number of rides being 5 to 6 minutes long.
- Bikes are rented most on weekdays during morning and evening commutes and on weekends.
- Men are more likely to use Citi Bike than women.
- The majority of Citi Bike users have a subscription.

### Further Analysis
Our data suggests that many Citi Bikes are used to commute to and from work. In order to see how popular Citi Bike is among tourists, a distinction needs to be made between usage during commute hours and usage outside of those hours, such as:
- A comparison between the ratio of subscribers versus non-subscribers during peak hours and non peak hours. How many users that use the service to commute to  and from work have a subscription, and how does that compare to users that use the service outside of commute hours on weekdays and on weekends?
- A comparison between the most popular stops during peak hours and non peak hours to show when users ride the bikes to and from residential and office locations versus popular tourist attractions.
